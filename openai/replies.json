I don't think you could even continue to sell these courses. Unfortunately, I can no longer cancel the current course, but I will cancel the next course. Your courses do not meet basic standards. Too bad.",

    "review": "The content is ok but the links between videos and sections aren't always obvious. I like the fact that it goes in dept on my subjects but the quality of the audio isn't always good enough. I would still recommend to someone that really want to have a better understanding of AI/ML or specifically logistic regression but expect some extra reading if you really want to understand all the concepts well.",

    "review": "Much was great, some frequently explained by referring to other courses as well as skipping some code blocks or instrumental variables, which were readily explained in chat gpt by asking if to add copious explanatory comments. Most, but certainly not all AI ML course instructors are more concerned with taking the time to explain finer details of the code. Early parts on ANN and CNN were excellent in presentation although this was simpler material. In the course was more presenting and explaining than teaching how to code the models, both necessary individually and together sufficient for a solid learning experience. Perhaps sacrifice some optional topics for more time indepth to the course essentials - quantity versus quality.",

Please ensure you meet the prerequisites as listed twice in the course description and several more times in lectures such as \"how to succeed in this course\".

I already have courses on that, so check those out instead."

    "review": "Interesting course with lots of examples and lectures. Although some parts of the course become repetitive. There are lectures where he explains the code step by step and then goes on to repeat the same thing in the \"... in Python\" lectures. It would have been nice if he had proposed other exercises with a different dataset than the lectures, even though he does not provide the solution. It is fine to say that we should try to write the code ourselves first and then check the solution, but when this is reduced to copy and paste from the previous lecture it seems ridiculous to me.",
    "response": "This is a practical course, meaning that you are shown the code and can do with it what you wish (there's no way to \"exercise\" writing library code without first being shown the syntax, which doesn't make any sense). Additionally, repetition is a research-backed learning technique: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8442015/ Furthermore, please remember that the course is not customized to you. Therefore, if you personally choose to avoid repetition, you are free to do so, nobody is stopping you."

I challenge you to list specific examples instead of vague accusations like \"inadequately prepared\" and \"noticeable absence of demonstrations\".\n\n> disproportionate emphasis on paid websites over free alternatives\n\nThat is merely what you are paying attention to and triggered by. Most tools in the course are free or have free alternatives. Furthermore, I don't choose what's free, they are not my companies, so I am unsure why you think this is my fault...?"

This can be done if we have 100% free time for 4 weeks. Good thing is if you have little idea of Calculus and we flow what is being taught, this course will make us ready to understand ML. Having said that the instructor should again go back and try to minimize the un-necessary or repetitive content.",

Please recall that each section is denoted as \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", or \"advanced\" (as stated in the intro). One must choose according to their own skill level.

The slides are not being \"read\", and anyone taking the course can confirm this fact readily, so this comment is both inaccurate and misleading to potential students."

If you add additional resources(eg: citation as you should!) we can read and understand your variables, also many textbooks use different notations, so you need to make your description clear.
